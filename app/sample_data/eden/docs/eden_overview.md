# Introduction

Eden's [mission](/docs/overview/mission) is to make expressive generative AI tools which are accessible to creators, and to foster a fun, social, and collaborative ecosystem around AI art.

Our flagship product is a social network that enables creators to generate, share, and remix art, train custom models, and deploy interactive agents and chatbots. We also provide a [convenient SDK](/docs/sdk/quickstart) that allows developers to build their own apps on top of Eden.

Eden was founded by a team of artists, creative technologists, and longtime machine learners. We are [committed to open source](https://github.com/abraham-ai), and a highly community-driven project, with numerous ways for creators and developers to plug in and contribute.

# Overview

These docs are divided into two sections. 

The first section provides a set of guides for working with Eden as a creator, including:

- [How to use the creation tool](/docs/guides/creation) to make creations in the form of images, videos, and text.
- [How to train custom models or "concepts"](/docs/guides/concepts) in order to tailor the generators towards a specific domain, style, genre, or character.
- [How to deploy your own characters](/docs/guides/characters), autonomous creative agents with whom you can chat with, assign artistic tasks to, or challenge other characters to debates or games.

The second section is a technical reference containing:

- [An introduction to the Eden API and SDK](/docs/sdk/quickstart), a JavaScript library that allows you to interact with Eden programatically and build custom applications with it.
- [A guide for how to host custom models or code](/docs/sdk/generators) on Eden.

# Mission

With the rise of generative models that produce realistic text, images, video, and sound, a new artform and industry has formed atop a relatively small cache of open-source models, datasets, code, and compute resources. Many tools, services, and APIs have emerged to support users of these resources and meet the needs of this ecosystem.

Despite the prevalence of open-source models and tooling, much effort is duplicated reinventing solutions to common problems such as data acquisition, training, customizing, deployment, and serving models in a reliable and efficient way. Most of these services are closed or proprietary, creating platform risk for users and application developers, and limiting innovation from users who are unable to access or modify the underlying code or data.

Eden improves this by fostering a commons for the generative AI space.

Our core principles are:

- **Open source and open access**. We believe in the power of open source software to foster innovation, collaboration, and democratization in AI.
- **Creator-centric**. We believe that creators should in charge and in control of their own data and artistic outputs.
- **Interoperable and composable**. We strive to make our tools maximally expandable, adaptable, and interoperable with other platforms and tools.

Problems we are trying to solve:

* **Curation and discovery**: in the age of infinite content, how can we help users create or find what they are looking for?
* **Cold-start problem**: how can new artistic projects get off the ground without a large corpus of data or a large audience?
* **Generative AI platform risk**: how can we ensure that users are not locked into a single platform or service?

# Manna

Manna is the internal currency of Eden. Creators must expend Manna to take actions on Eden, including to [make creations](/docs/guides/creation).

The [creation tool](https://app.eden.art/create) is priced according to the following:
* Each image produced by /create and /remix costs 1 manna.
* Each vieeo produced by /interpolate and /real2real costs 1 manna per frame.

## How to get manna

New users receive 1000 free manna upon sign-up.

To top up, manna may be purchased as well.

The Eden team actively gives out free manna to community members who actively contribute to Eden in some way. To learn more or propose collaborations, get in touch with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/4dSYwDT).
