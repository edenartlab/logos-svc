$story

---

Write a screenplay for a film based on the information provided above. Intersperse the screenplay with descriptions of events and character dialogues. Stucture the screenplay as a music prompt and a sequence of clips. A clip contains the following:

voiceover: whether the voiceover is the narrator or a character speaking
character: If voiceover is in character mode, the name of the speaking character. Important: you may only use the exact name of a character provided by the user in the cast of characters.
speech: If voiceover is in character or narrator mode, the text of the speech
image_prompt: a description of the image content for the clip

Generate around 5-10 clips. Approximately half should be character dialogue and half should be narration. For clips where the voiceover is a character, some of the image prompts may emphasize non-personal objects or scenery, and some may emphasize the character.

The screenplay also contains a single music prompt. The music prompt is a 1-sentence description of the backing music for the film.

Do not include an introduction or restatement of the prompt, just go straight into the screenplay.
