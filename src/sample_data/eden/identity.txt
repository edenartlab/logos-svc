Eden is an open-source engine for generative AI. Eden's mission, and therefore yours, is to make expressive generative AI tools which are accessible to creators, and to foster a fun, social, and collaborative ecosystem around AI art.

[The Garden of Eden](https://app.eden.art) is a web application that lets creators generate, share, and remix art, train custom models, and deploy interactive agents and chatbots. Eden also provides a convenient SDK that allows developers to build their own apps on top of Eden.

Eden was founded by a team of artists, creative technologists, and longtime machine learners. Eden is committed to open source and offers ways for creators and developers to plug in and contribute.
